<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From lighting, filtration, and stunning looks the Red Sea MAX E-all in one series has a great recipe for success allowing you to have your own piece of the ocean right in your living room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a long time coming for a company to come out with such an inclusive system like Red Sea. From ultra clear glass, proven filtration components and awesome lighting you probably will not be able to find a better tank and stand value package out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Red Sea MAX E-170 </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall dimensions:</strong> 24" L x 22.6" W x 56" H (light not included in height dimension)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Red Sea is constantly innovating and keeping up with current technology in the aquarium market, and reef keeping hobby. The MAX E tanks now include LED lighting along with a full filtration system, along with circulation and return pumps. The ultra clear glass lets you see your fish and corals true colors in a sophisticated rimless design that will instantly bring life and elegance to any room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Max-E tanks now include Red Sea ReefLED 90 Lights</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few years Red Sea has a lot of time dedicated to testing and researching LED lighting, and the culmination of those efforts led them to the ReefLED 90. Designed for optimal growth while producing great coloration with a pleasant shimmer effect. Red Sea didnt just stop with great function and form, they integrated the control of the light into the ReefBeat smart aquarium app. The ReefLED 90s built-in WiFi lets you directly connect the light to your smart device to set the daily schedule, color, intensity, and other features. Every Max-E Aquarium Kit includes the ReefLED lights along with the appropriate amount of mounting arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>One-Plug Power Center</strong></p>
<p>Connect up to 7 individually switched electrical items into the Red Sea MAX Power Center. Just a single plug needs to go to your walls outlet, and everything else can be controlled within the cabinet of the Max E aquariums through simple on/off rocker switches. Keeping the power center in the stand where there is no sump allows for a safe and convenient location letting you easily control your tank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MARINE-SPEC Cabinet</strong></p>
<p>Every MAX-E tank comes with a stand made for saltwater aquariums with marine-spec laminate cabinet, weatherproof epoxy painted doors, push open latches, and soft close stainless steel hinges. Stands are available in two exterior colors (black or pearl white) where the interior will be black on both stand color options allowing for a cleaner overall appearance over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ultra Clear Glass</strong></p>
<p>Standard glass can "wash" out colors because of a small percentage of iron in all glass making it have a slight yellowing appearance. Red Sea uses an Ultra Clear beveled edge glass that has a low iron content allowing you to see the true color of your fish and coral without having any color distortion. The 12mm thick front glass lets Red Sea produce a rimless tank without the need for any ugly bracing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Filtration and Circulation</strong></p>
<p>Proven Multi-stage filtration lets you keep even the most delicate corals and fish. The included return and circulation pumps are secretly hidden in the filtration compartment keeping the display portion looking clean and elegant. Along with the Reef-Spec MSK900 skimmer, media towers, extra space for additional filters and provisions to add a chiller too.</p>
<p>MSK900 skimmers have a 3:1 water to air ratio creating the perfect skimming conditions within the body of the skimmer. With the advanced design of the protein skimmer, it will not be affected by water fluctuations due to evaporation and has an adjustable outlet gate creating the perfect skimmate consistency for the water conditions.</p>
